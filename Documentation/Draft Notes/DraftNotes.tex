Problem understanding
 - in a sense a lack of engaging material is a problem
 - lack of engaging material with in built ecosystems to trade and share in game items with others
 - having this capactiy will allow for a more engaging and cooperative experience and could also install 
 a sense of valuing money for younger children or give bargaining/ business mindset to older generations
 - Problem: lack of pass time activites instilling real world economic understanding (eg trading/ bargaining)

Software review 
 - previous software attempting to solve a similar problem
 - TRADING SIMILAR
 - eg WoW or rune scape, games in which you can trade
 - World of warcraft - could sell items to a shop or trade with players
 - Runescape (similar to above I believe)
 - Fifa (trading coins)
 - lot of issues these games face is that there was not a formal trading process opening people up to scams
 eg kids would trust someone who said if they dropped an item they would send x amount of coins then the player
 would just take the item and leave the game. Having a formal secure process would prevent this
 - it can be seen as gambling for younger kids which is illegal - while this is true for these other games
 as they require the input of real money, this games currency will only be generated through time spent in the game. 
 This will mean that it isn't actually spending any real money.
 - GAMEPLAY SIMILAR
 - Having an RTS type game like:
 - clash royale
 - that kingdom fighting game
 - These types of games allow for the purchase of a wider variety of things as you can add different types of units
 for people to unlock or trade and depending on how many types of that unit that player has will determine the level 
 which will affect damage output etc. 
 - These games will be more balanced and rigorously tested but without trading they will lose that tactical aspect.

Hypothesis 
 - 1 there are few to no games that offer complete monetary freedom and enjoyable gameplay without 
 microtransactions affecting the ethicality of allowing such games to be played by all ages.
 - There are few to no experiences that allow a player to freely trade with other players through a formal means, 
 allowing for a tactical aspect of being able to bargain well.

Prototyping 
 - Prototype 1 - develop a networked game for players to play and a trading platform for players to interact
 - Prototype 2 - develop a more detailed game with engaging mechanics
 - Prototype 3 - Have the game able to be played between players

Code Design
 - using unity:
    - uses scripts that you can attach to ingame objects or leave as static
    - uses oobjects in the scene to represent actual objects in the code
    - have an object controlling network operations and objects controlling UI

Coding and testing 
 - include clever code
 - eg code for networking
 - using events rather than having code be interlinked
 - raycasts
 - Code for database of items owned
 - code for trading platform
 - TESTING
  - using parellsync to test netoworking on the fly
