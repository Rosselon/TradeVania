- A client callback is used on the update function to prevent the server from attempting to call it (client callback is used rather than just the client tag to prevent errors).

- This file cleverly incorporates raycasting to decide where to spawn the attacker
- Firstly the game checks whether the left mouse button has been clicked to determine whether it should create a ray.
- Then once this has occured the ray is created using the main camera.
- The ScreenPoint to ray function is a function in the camera class that takes a 2D vector and creates a ray from the camera through that point.
- This means that the ray will correspond appropriately to where user clicks.
- The ray is then checked to see if it hits anything and if it has will assign the "hit" variable. 
- This "hit" variable can then be used for a multitude of purposes but in this case will just be used decide if the player has clicked 
	within range of their base and will be fed into the CmdSpawnAttacker function as the location the attacker should instantiate.
